# Object-Detection-with-DBScan-Algotithm

This is the Programming Assignment for CSI2110-Data Structure and Algorithms take in Fall 2022. 
The assignment uses DB Scan algorithm to find the K-nearest-neighbors using Java. It also finds the cluster having the minimum points specifies and the epsilon distance  between them. It also visualize the clusters using the provided python script in viz-script by the prof.
